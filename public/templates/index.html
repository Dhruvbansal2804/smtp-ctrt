		<p>Introducing the Clinical Trial Registry Template â€“ a transformative initiative to advance medical research worldwide. Clinical trial registries are crucial for transparency, data accessibility, and safeguarding participants' rights. Aligned with WHO Guidelines defined in the <a href="https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/274994/9789241514743-eng.pdf" target="_blank">International Standards for Clinical Trial Registries</a>, this template adheres to global standards, fostering collaboration and credibility. Developed at <a href="https://www.icmr.gov.in/" target="_blank">the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)</a>, it will be distributed as a public digital good at the <a href="https://www.g20.org/en/" target="_blank">G20 Summit</a>, empowering nations to implement robust registries and accelerate progress for better health outcomes with minimal cost and effort. Let's propel medical research into a new era of openness and innovation together.</p>
